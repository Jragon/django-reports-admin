# This file contains a list of commits that should be ignored when git-blame is
# used. One example are commits that automatically format code without making
# any functional changes: they are usually not helpful when blaming a file to
# find out about the context of a given line.
#
# The path to this file can be passed to the `ignore-revs-file` argument of
# git-blame. If you want the following commits to be automatically ignore, you
# can set the blame.ignoreRevsFile config option:
#
#     $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# [2021-02-06] formatting comit (with black)
